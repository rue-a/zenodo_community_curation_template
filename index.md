# `Zenodo Curation Policy Template`

> Text boxes like this one are comments and should be deleted in the actual policy. 

This is the curation policy of the *\<Chair of ... of TU Dresden\>*. Submitted records have to adhere to the rules defined below. Community curators have the right to apply changes to the metadata of your record, request you to update your record according to the rules below or reject your submission. The policy defines general requirements and specifies them further by record type.

### General Requirements

When submitting a record, the metadata fields __*Description*__ and __*Licenses*__ are **mandatory**.

### Specific Requirements for Dataset

Any dataset should be provided as a compressed ZIP-file. Ideally, the contents of this ZIP-file are self-explanatory to the extent that anyone can use the dataset without additional information.

#### Contents of the ZIP-file

- Provide every file in a [non-proprietary format](https://lib.guides.umbc.edu/c.php?g=728911&p=5872066), if possible.
- Include or link to any auxiliary file that was used to produce the data (scripts, ontologies, ...).
- File names may only contain the 26 lowercase letters of the *[ISO basic Latin alphabet](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5974462)*, *[arabic numerals](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29961325)*, the *[hyphen-minus](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q617884)* (`-`), and the *[underscore](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11199)* (`_`). A dot (`.`) may only be used to separate filename from file extension. Use the underscore as semantically stronger separating than the hyphen-minus. Avoid using more than 100 characters in a filename.
- If possible, file names should be human readable, i.e. contain easily readable information about their content. 
- Add a Readme file to the root directory and each sub-directory. In their respective directory, the Readme files should briefly describe every auxiliary-file and directory, and comprehensively describe any data-file. Readme files should be provided in the [Markdown file format](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) (`README.md`) or as plain text file (`README.txt`).
- Add a license file named [`LICENSE.txt`](https://creativecommons.org/2014/01/07/plaintext-versions-of-creative-commons-4-0-licenses/) to the root directory.
- Add a citation information file named [`CITATION.cff`](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) to the root directory.

> The Readme files could be replaced by formalized metadata files. See, e.g., [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) or [Automatic Generation of Interoperable Scientific Data – A Use Case with Electrochemistry Data](https://zenodo.org/records/10069113).

### Specific Requirements for Event

If the event has a website, provide a link to this website.

*--- brief description of the lesson ---*
